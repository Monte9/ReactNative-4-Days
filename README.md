# React Native 4 Days

This summer I got into React Native and absolutely loved it! Coming from an iOS background, it was not too difficult to learn and was hella fun. Although I could build a simple React Native app.. I wanted to dive deeper into React Native and be able to work on more complex apps with fancier UI's. Hence this repo.

This project is inspired by [30 Days of React Native](https://github.com/fangwei716/30-days-of-react-native). For the most part, I will be following the projects on the repo pretty closely.

# Getting started

You will need Xcode, node.js, the React Native command line tools, and Watchman.

1. Xcode: Get Xcode from the [App Store here](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12)
2. node.js:
- If you're using OS X or Windows, the best way to install Node.js is to use one of the installers from the Node.js [download page here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). [Read more..](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node)
-Or install npm via homebrew like so: `brew install node`
3. React Native command line tool: `npm install -g react-native-cli`
4. Watchman: `brew install watchman`
5. Finally create a new React Native app: `react-native init ReactNative4Days`
